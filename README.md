# What I Learned
During this project, I wanted to improve my typography this project helped reveal to me more ways that typography can be used and implemented. It's important for a 
developer to determine exactly how a website should look so that users will automatically appeal to the site. I notice that I still need improvements in my typography regarding when to center align texts, what lengths texts should be left-aligned or center aligned, how much line height is needed according to font-size. I now know that smaller font-size requires increase in line height, and bigger font-size requires decrease in line-height

CSS flexbox: Before this project, i already had a good basic understanding of flexbox. This project helped improve my understanding towards a more deeper level. It made me recognize my habits as an engineer when making flexbox layouts and allowed me to know exactly which properties will best suit how pictures and texts should be structured

# What Made This Project Fun

The part of the project where I was baffled the most was the curvy backgrounds. Initially, I was completely stuck on how to get both the background containers and curvy images to become one. I decided to hold off on that part till the last so I can spend the most time on it. Although the solution was so so so simple, figuring out what I had to use to solve my problem was really fun. The solution was a really basic display: inherit; But I kept overthinking it and setting background images trying to make something simple more complex. 

When I figured out that I can just use one simple property I was utterly relieved and from that point on I just happily finished up this project. The sense of accomplishment and problem solving will always be something I look forward to in programming.
