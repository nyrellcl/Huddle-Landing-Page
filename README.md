# What I Learned
During this project, I wanted to improve my typography this project helped reveal to me more ways that typography can be used and implemented. It's important for a 
developer to determine exactly how a website should look so that users will automatically appeal to the site. I notice that I still need improvements in my typography regarding when to center align texts, what lengths texts should be left-aligned or center aligned, how much line height is needed according to font-size. I now know that smaller font-size requires increase in line height, and bigger font-size requires decrease in line-height

CSS flexbox: Before this project, i already had a good basic understanding of flexbox. This project helped improve my understanding towards a more deeper level. It made me recognize my habits as an engineer when making flexbox layouts and allowed me to know exactly which properties will best suit how pictures and texts should be structured
